# Uptimerobot in Python

Some code hosting/running services (such as [repl.it](https://repl.it/)) started blocking [Uptimerobot](https://https://uptimerobot.com/) IPs so I decided to make my own. 

## How it works
It runs off Python and is pretty simple. It sends a request to your specified url and dumps the r.text into temp.txt, then waits a specific amount of time.

## Setup and use
It depends on requests which can be installed by running `pip install requests` in command prompt.
From there, just download main.py and run it!
